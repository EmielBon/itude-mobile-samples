# Shared Resources Sample projects

These samples demonstrate the mechanism by which you can develop your MOBBL iOS and Android applications using a single set of resources. When developing an application for iOS and Android, the user interface sections of the config are usually different from each other, but most of the controller and generally all of the model sections are the same. This setup allows you to really write once and deploy multiple times.

## Overview

The set of samples consists of three projects:

- sample Android project
- sample iOS project
- sample resources project

All three are maven projects. The Android and iOS project are dependent on the sample resources project. See the README files of the respective projects for more specific information.
